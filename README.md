# IntroToSpring

Spring is a popular Java-based framework used for building enterprise-level applications. It provides a wide range of features and tools that make it easier for developers to create high-quality, scalable, and maintainable applications. Some of the key features of Spring include dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, data access, and transaction management. Spring also integrates well with other popular technologies in the Java ecosystem such as Hibernate, JPA, and JMS.

Overall, Spring Java simplifies the development process by providing a comprehensive set of tools and features, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic rather than worrying about low-level implementation details.
